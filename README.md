I'm crafting a 3D website where users can interact with a stack of objects that reflect aspects of my identity. At the moment, it features three items, and with a simple click, their order shuffles, symbolizing the fluid nature of priorities. In the future, I plan to evolve this into a platform where users can create their own stacks with personal objects. The idea is to add a bit of physics to the mix, letting users play with the balance and dynamics of their stacks. It's an engaging way to visualize and reflect on the ever-changing hierarchy of personal values and interests.
